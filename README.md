PouncingIguana's Repetier Firmware
==================================
This is forked from SeeMeCNC's dormant port of Repetier for anyone
running a Rambo or Mini Rambo. I'll be doing tweaks here and there,
possibly some code cleanup, and whatever else I decide I want my printer
to do. Use at your own risk.

Arduino Version
---------------
Make sure you are compiling this firmware with Arduino 1.6.0 - newer
versions will not work.

Pre-Compiled Images
-------------------
In the Images directory, you'll find a few pre-compiled images for some
of the SeeMeCNC printers. You can just blast these straight on to your
printer if you don't feel like messing around with Arduino.
